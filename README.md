# SerraAutoLogin
Automatic scheduled login for the Pisa University Network "SerRa"

App to perform login at fixed intervals inside the ‘SerRA’ network of University of Pisa.

How many times were you doing something and brutally the connection went down because of the session expired?

The app is created mainly for all the students that lives into the DSU dormitories.

Sometimes it’s just annoying but other times it’s really a problem (e.g. play online multiplayer games).
The default captive portal URL is ‘auth5.unipi.it‘ but you can (actually you should) change it from the settings. Replace it with the one that usually appears in your browser.

The app is written in Python 3.4 and use some third libraries. Mainly: requests and PyQt5.

I compiled an executable version for Windows with cx_Freeze.
